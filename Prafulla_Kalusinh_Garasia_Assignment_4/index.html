					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>Subway Surfers is an endless runner mobile game co-developed by Kiloo and SYBO Games, private companies based in Denmark. 
					It is available on Android, iOS, Kindle, and Windows Phone platforms and uses the Unity game engine.
					In the game, players take the role of young graffiti artists who, upon being caught in the act of "tagging" a metro railway site, run through the railroad tracks to escape from the inspector and his dog. 
					As they run, they grab gold coins, power-ups, and other items along the way while simultaneously dodging collisions with trains and other objects, and they can also jump on top of the trains and surf with hoverboards to evade capture until the character crashes into an obstacle, gets caught by the inspector, or gets hit by a train, at which point the game will be over. 
					Special events, such as the Weekly Hunt, can result in in-game rewards and characters.</p>

					<h2>Gameplay</h2>
					<p>Subway Surfers is an endless runner video game. The game starts by tapping the touchscreen, while Jake (the game's starter character) or any other character sprays graffiti on a subway, 
					and then gets caught in the act by the inspector and his dog, who starts chasing the character. While running, the player can swipe up, down, left, or right to avoid crashing into oncoming obstacles especially moving subways, poles, tunnel walls and barriers. 
					By swiping rapidly as speed increases, more points can be acquired. A crash results in a game over, but the player can continue running by using keys. The player can collect various items such as coins, keys, score multipliers, super sneakers, jetpacks, magnets, mystery boxes and power jumpers. 
					A power jumper provides combustion by launching up the character, while a jetpack has an ability to fly, a coin magnet that attracts all coins on the track, super sneakers that gives the ability to jump higher and a score multiplier that multiplies the score. 
					Items, such as a hoverboard, allows the character to avoid collisions lasting about 30 seconds.</p>
